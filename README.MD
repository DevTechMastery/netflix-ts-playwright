This project is a TypeScript-based test automation project using Playwright for automating tests on the Netflix website. Playwright is a powerful tool that allows developers to write browser automation scripts in multiple programming languages, including TypeScript.

The main goal of this project is to automate various test scenarios on the Netflix website, ensuring that the application functions correctly and meets the desired quality standards. By automating these tests, we can save time and effort in manual testing, while also increasing the overall test coverage.

Some of the key features of this project include:
- Writing test scripts in TypeScript, which provides strong typing and better code organization.
- Utilizing Playwright's powerful API to interact with the Netflix website, including navigating through pages, filling forms, clicking buttons, and verifying expected results.
- Integrating with continuous integration tool GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on every code change.

By using this test automation project, we can ensure the stability and reliability of the Netflix website, providing a seamless user experience for millions of users worldwide.
